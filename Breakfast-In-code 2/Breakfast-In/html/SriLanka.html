       <h3>Cultural heritage and significance to Sri Lanka</h3>
       <p>A renowned traditional dish in Sri Lanka, its is often served at breakfast. The dish is unique to Sri Lanka and its said that the Lord Buddha was offered Kiribath (Milk Rice), while meditating under the bodhi tree,
        days before he gained enlightenment.</p>
       <p>On special occassions, in a Sinhalese home (e.g.weddings, births) Kiribath (Milk Rice) plays a significant role in festivities and auspicious occassions symbolising the beginning of
        new pursuits in life and transitions. Thus it is often made for for good luck and blesings, hence its madee on the morning of the first of the month and New Year,
        eaten as the first meal on each of these occassions.
        This is after observances and rituals like offering Kiribath (Milk Rice) to Lord Buddha and lighting an oil lamp. After which the first meal of the year commences.
        The family eat from the same rice as its symbolic of dinning together with Buddha eating with the deities.
        On these occassions the Kiribath (Mlik Rice) is served as the centre piece of the meal.
        Its served alongside sambols, bananas, traditional Sri Lankan sweets and other delicacies. The dish symbolises life and therefore the head of the family feds a mouthful to the rest of the family.
        Its the first solid food fed to an infant and to brides by the bridegrooms at their wedding.
        Its traditionally eaten by hand.</p>
       <p>There are two other variations of Kiribath- Mung kiribath (Milk Rice) where you add boiled green gram to the cooking rice and
        Imbul Kiribath (Milk Rice) where the rice is spread on a tortilla (traditionally a banana leaf) and a sweet filling of coconut and jaggery (called Pani Pol) is placed in the center.
        The banana leaf is then folded and rolled and pressed vertically and pressed firm giving its a cylindrical shape.
